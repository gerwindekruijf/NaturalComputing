## Readme

In order to run the simulations we used for this report, the only thing needed to do is to click on the html files. As long as the whole repo is there, they should work. 
Note that these simulations are based on the simulations presented within this [Github Repo by Inge Wortel](https://github.com/ingewortel/artistoo)

- Obstacle Simulator: Original (baseline) simulation with obstacles
- Obstacle Simulator alternative: Extra cell added (green, blue colors)
- Obstacle Simulator more blocks: Simulation with the funnel of obstacles
